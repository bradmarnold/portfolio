        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m <strong>Bradford Arnold</strong>, a designer, maker and student based in Texas.  By day I study at the University of
            Texas at Arlington; in my free time I volunteer at the UTA Fab Lab, teach pattern drafting and pursue hands‑on engineering
            projects.  My work blends three core passions:
        </p>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Modern craft:</strong> I use digital tools like Seamly2D for pattern drafting and CNC machines for wood and metal
                fabrication, then translate those designs into physical objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable engineering:</strong> I’m building a low‑cost aquaponics sensor suite that monitors pH, temperature
                and total dissolved solids in real time.  The data will power a web dashboard and support a paper on accessible
                200‑liter tank designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional heritage:</strong> I study historical tailoring texts and adapt early 20th‑century pattern‑cutting
                methods for today’s makers.  This research has shaped the standardized jeans and trucker‑jacket patterns I teach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Upcoming projects include CNC‑plasma‑cut Chinese vegetable knives and spatulas with hand‑turned handles, and a maple‑framed
            cloud chamber with upgraded Peltier coolers for more efficient particle tracking.  Whether I’m coding sensors,
            turning a wooden grip on a lathe or drafting a pair of jeans, I’m driven by curiosity and by the desire to make craft more
            accessible.
        </p>

        <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
        <p>
            At UTA’s Fab Lab I run a volunteer programme that guides beginners through every step of making their own jeans or
            trucker jacket.  We start by drafting patterns in Seamly2D using a blend of early 20th‑century manuals such as the
            <em>Blue Book of Men’s Tailoring</em> and the Müller &amp; Sohn system.  By studying these historic methods we honour the craft of
            tailoring while translating it for today’s makers.  Our core garment is a denim jacket adapted from 19th‑century French chore
            coats and carpenter’s coats; as the silhouette evolved into Levi’s Type I, Type II and finally the Type III “trucker” jacket
            of the 1960s, the garment transitioned from utilitarian workwear to a fashion icon.  We analyse those evolutions to design a
            standardised jacket and jeans pattern that is both authentic and approachable.
        </p>
        <h3>Program steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Draft the sloper:</strong> Students use Seamly2D to draft a basic trouser or shirt sloper using their own
                measurements.  I explain each measurement and demonstrate the software tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert to a garment pattern:</strong> We adapt the sloper into a jeans pattern or a Type III‑style trucker jacket,
                drawing on historical sources and modern fit adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Laser‑cut muslin:</strong> The pattern is exported to SVG/DXF and cut on the Fab Lab’s laser cutter.  Over the past
                months I’ve calibrated power and speed settings on scrap denim and muslin to cut cleanly without scorching, reducing
                waste and improving efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Fit and adjust:</strong> Students sew the muslin test garment, assess the fit, and tweak the pattern – deepening
                armholes or adjusting leg panels as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut Cone Denim:</strong> Once the fit is dialled in, we cut the final pieces from Cone Denim.  Securing a
                sponsorship means participants can make jeans at little or no cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Sew the final garment:</strong> In the Fab Lab I guide students through construction techniques: sewing,
                top‑stitching, attaching pockets, and finishing seams.  We document each project with photos and notes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This sequence reduces barriers to entry by removing tedious hand‑cutting, minimising material waste and providing a supportive
            studio environment.  It embodies Cone Denim’s emphasis on heritage, innovation and sustainability – the mill has over
            130 years of experience supplying high‑quality denim and maintains long‑term
            relationships with customers while continuously evolving its products.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are a few examples of student work and process images. These will be updated with your own photos of laser‑cut pattern
            tests, muslin prototypes, finished denim pieces and a student drafting in Seamly2D. Until then, these placeholders help
            visualise the process.

                <p>
                    I’m developing a low‑cost monitoring system for a 200&nbsp;L aquaponics tank. Using open‑source hardware I’m measuring pH,
                    temperature and total dissolved solids in real time. A custom web application will display live readings alongside
                    24‑hour trends so I can spot fluctuations throughout the day. I plan to publish a guide for building and adapting the
                    system for educational or personal use.

                <p>
                    By taking advantage of the FabLab’s CNC plasma cutter I’m fabricating a series of food‑safe steel kitchen tools. The project
                    includes Chinese vegetable knives and spatulas cut from 16‑gauge sheet. I’ll turn intricate grips on the CNC lathe and craft
                    wooden handles to finish the spatulas, experimenting with evenly bending the steel for the perfect curve.

                <p>
                    My current cloud chamber uses a metal frame that loses too much cold through conduction. I’m designing a 25&nbsp;×&nbsp;25&nbsp;cm
                    frame from maple to improve insulation and aesthetics. Paired with higher‑quality Peltier coolers and temperature probes,
                    the wooden frame should yield a more stable environment for observing particle tracks.

        <h2>Documentation &amp; Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past year I’ve been producing video tutorials to demystify the pattern‑drafting process.  The videos walk viewers
            through drafting a basic trouser block in Seamly2D, covering everything from entering measurements and using perpendicular
            lines to applying formulas that shape the waistband, crotch and leg.  Each tutorial is scripted to highlight the order of
            operations, the tools introduced at each step, and the underlying equations so that anyone can follow along at their own pace.
            These resources will live here once editing is complete.  In the meantime, the stills below preview the interface and give a
            sense of the content.

    <!-- Cone Denim section describing sponsorship usage -->

        <h2>Cone&nbsp;Denim Sponsorship</h2>
        <!-- Highlight the purpose of the denim using a subheading -->
        <h3>What will Cone Denim’s fabric be used for?</h3>
        <p>
            I’m seeking a partnership with Cone&nbsp;Denim to provide fabric for my volunteer programme and future research.  The mill’s
            heritage of supplying high‑quality denim for over 130 years resonates with my mission to blend tradition and innovation.  Cone’s
            fabric will be used primarily in classes at the University of Texas at Arlington’s Fab Lab, where students and faculty learn
            to draft, laser‑cut and sew their own garments.  Each participant will use Cone denim to create their first pair of jeans or a
            Type III‑style trucker jacket, guided from digital pattern drafting to final construction.  Outside of coursework, the denim
            will also support future class projects and studio workshops that explore the intersection of heritage denim craftsmanship and
            modern making.
        </p>
        <p>
            By lowering the cost of entry, this sponsorship will make high‑quality materials accessible to students and ensure the
            longevity of the program.  I’ll document techniques, share patterns and publish videos so makers everywhere can experiment
            with Cone fabrics for personal projects and independent study.  The fabric will also accompany research on accessible 200‑liter
            aquaponics tanks and other multidisciplinary projects, illustrating how a single resource can inspire cross‑disciplinary
            learning.

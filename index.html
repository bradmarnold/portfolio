        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm a designer and maker based in Texas. My work bridges the gap between classical garment construction and contemporary
            technology. Whether I'm drafting denim patterns, building an aquaponics sensor network or machining custom kitchen tools,
            I strive to create projects that are functional, sustainable and educational.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the workshop I volunteer at the University of Texas at Arlington’s FabLab, where I teach students how to draft,
            cut and sew their own garments from muslin prototypes through to finished pieces. In my free time I explore aquaponics,
            CNC fabrication, woodworking and the history of tailoring.
        </p>

        <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
        <p>
            At UTA’s FabLab I run a volunteer programme that guides students through the entire garment‑making process – from taking their own
            measurements to walking away with a finished piece.  We begin by drafting patterns in Seamly2D using a blend of early
            20th‑century pattern‑making texts, including the <em>Blue Book of Men's Tailoring</em> and the Müller&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Sohn system.
            By studying these historic methods we honour the craft of tailoring while translating it for today’s makers.  Our core pattern is a
            denim jacket adapted from 19th‑century French chore coats and carpenter’s coats; as this silhouette evolved into Levi’s Type&nbsp;I,
            Type&nbsp;II and finally the Type&nbsp;III “trucker” jacket of the 1960s, the garment transitioned from utilitarian workwear to a
            fashion icon.  We analyse those evolutions – much like fashion scholars study James Dean’s and Elvis’ leather jackets of the 1950s –
            to design a standardised jacket and jeans pattern that is both authentic and approachable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the draft is complete we plot it digitally and send it to the laser cutter.  Over the past few months I’ve tested a range of
            power and speed settings on scrap denim and muslin to find the sweet spot that cuts cleanly without scorching, improving both
            efficiency and sustainability.  Each new design is prototyped in muslin and adjusted for fit; for example, I recently deepened the
            armhole on a jacket and corrected a missing section on a trouser leg before cutting the final pieces.  The refinement continues
            through multiple fittings until the pattern can be cut in denim with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teaching is at the heart of this programme.  I’ve prepared detailed written guides and videos that walk beginners through the
            drafting equations, the order of operations in Seamly2D and the use of tools like perpendicular lines when drawing a waistband.
            Prior to recording, I script each video to ensure a logical flow and clarity.  During individual sessions I mentor students
            step‑by‑step: Day&nbsp;1 covers measuring and creating a basic trouser sloper, Day&nbsp;2 adapts that sloper into jeans and
            tests the fit in muslin, and Day&nbsp;3 is spent cutting and sewing the final denim garment.  One student I’m currently helping
            started with zero experience and is now drafting his own jeans after just a few hours of instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
            None of this would be possible without community support.  I’m collaborating with faculty members and seeking sponsorship from Cone
            Denim – the mill that supplies fabric for Levi’s – so that every participant can sew a pair of jeans without prohibitive costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are a few examples of student work and process images.  These will be updated with your own photos of laser‑cut pattern
            tests, muslin prototypes, finished denim pieces and a student drafting in Seamly2D.  Until then, these placeholders help
            visualise the process.

                <h3>Automated Aquaponics Sensor Network</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m developing a low‑cost monitoring system for a 200&nbsp;L aquaponics tank. Using open‑source hardware I’m measuring pH,
                    temperature and total dissolved solids in real time. A custom web application will display live readings alongside
                    24‑hour trends so I can spot fluctuations throughout the day. I plan to publish a guide for building and adapting the
                    system for educational or personal use.

                <h3>CNC‑Cut Kitchen Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    By taking advantage of the FabLab’s CNC plasma cutter I’m fabricating a series of food‑safe steel kitchen tools. The project
                    includes Chinese vegetable knives and spatulas cut from 16‑gauge sheet. I’ll turn intricate grips on the CNC lathe and craft
                    wooden handles to finish the spatulas, experimenting with evenly bending the steel for the perfect curve.

                <h3>Maple Cloud Chamber Frame</h3>
                <p>
                    My current cloud chamber uses a metal frame that loses too much cold through conduction. I’m designing a 25&nbsp;×&nbsp;25&nbsp;cm
                    frame from maple to improve insulation and aesthetics. Paired with higher‑quality Peltier coolers and temperature probes,
                    the wooden frame should yield a more stable environment for observing particle tracks.
